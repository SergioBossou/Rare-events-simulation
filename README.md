# Rare-events-simulation
Simulation of rare events in the context of the spread of an epidemic based on SIR model.

## Motivation
In 1760, Daniel Bernouilli published hisTrial of a new analysis of mortality caused by smallpox & the benefits of inoculation to prevent it. This work, probably the first of its kind, highlights the effectiveness of vaccination and the effects of contact parameters in the spread of epidemics, and informs political decision-makers on public health issues. Today, in a context of globalized epidemics, advanced modeling offers the tools to measure risk and control as well as possible an unprecedented complex situation. 

Epidemiologists, applied mathematicians, data scientists and computer scientists are cooperating to collect, analyze, understand and predict the evolution and spread of the Covid-19 virus. In this context, it has been all the more interesting to study these current problems of modeling and risk calculation.
